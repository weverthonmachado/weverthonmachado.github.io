Currently, I’m a postdoctoral researcher in the Department of Sociology at Utrecht University.\nMy research interests lie mainly in the areas of social stratification and family dynamics and include union formation and dissolution, marriage markets, the gendered division of labor and, more generally, the several forms of inequality between and within families.\nI hold a Ph.D. in Sociology from the Institute of Social and Political Studies of the Rio de Janeiro State University. Before joining Utrecht University, I was a Max Weber Fellow at the European University Institute."

    "text": "Abstract\n\n\n\nUsing population register data from the Netherlands, we analyze the child penalty for new parents in three groups of couples: different-sex and female same-sex couples with a biological child and different-sex couples with an adopted child. With a longitudinal design, we follow parents’ earnings from two years before to eight years after the arrival of the child and use event study models to estimate the effects of the transition to parenthood on earnings trajectories. Comparing different groups of couples allows us to test hypotheses related to three types of within-couple differences that are difficult to disentangle when studying only heterosexual biological parents: relative earnings, childbearing, and gender. Our results offer strong support for gender as the main driver of divergent child penalties. The gender of their partners is more consequential for mothers’ earnings trajectories than is childbearing or the pre-parenthood relative earnings in the couple."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Abstract\n\n\n\nIn this paper, we investigate how the diffusion of dual-earner couples has affected aggregate levels of inequality in Brazil. More specifically, we analyze trends in the association between spouses’ earnings and assess their implications for earnings inequality among couples from 1993 to 2015. For this purpose, we use log-linear models to dis-tinguish three components of the association between spouses’ earnings: a) the correlation between spouses’ earnings among dual-earner couples; b) the relationship between husbands’ earnings and wives’ labor force participation; and c) the proportion of dual-earner couples. Counterfactual simulations allow us to estimate how inequality would change if the trends in the association between spouses’ earnings and each of its components had been different. We show that changes in the gradient of wives’ employment and compositional effects related to the increasing prevalence of dual-earner couples contributed to limit the decline in inequality over the studied period."

    "text": "Abstract\n\n\n\nThis chapter examines the stratification of access to higher education in Brazil between 2001 and 2015, a period of marked expansion of the higher education system. It draws on random samples of the Brazilian population to show the increase in the number of enrollments, as well as in the number of students eligible to make the transition to higher education. Coefficients from logistic regression models show the persistent effects of family background on the probability of achieving a college education, but also show decreasing disadvantages for African-Brazilian students. It discusses how shifts in the racial composition of the population vis-à-vis policies to mitigate inequalities of access can account for the increasing probability of African-Brazilian students attending college."
