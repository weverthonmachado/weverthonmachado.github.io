    "title": "The association between spouses’ earnings and trends in income inequality in Brazil (1993 – 2015)",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Abstract\n\n\n\nIn this paper, we investigate how the diffusion of dual-earner couples has affected aggregate levels of inequality in Brazil. More specifically, we analyze trends in the association between spouses’ earnings and assess their implications for earnings inequality among couples from 1993 to 2015. For this purpose, we use log-linear models to dis-tinguish three components of the association between spouses’ earnings: a) the correlation between spouses’ earnings among dual-earner couples; b) the relationship between husbands’ earnings and wives’ labor force participation; and c) the proportion of dual-earner couples. Counterfactual simulations allow us to estimate how inequality would change if the trends in the association between spouses’ earnings and each of its components had been different. We show that changes in the gradient of wives’ employment and compositional effects related to the increasing prevalence of dual-earner couples contributed to limit the decline in inequality over the studied period."

    "title": "Trends in Educational Assortative Mating in Brazil: 1960-2015",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Abstract\n\n\n\nUsing both census and survey data, this study analyzes educational assortative mating trends over half a century in Brazil. Odds of both overall and group-specific homogamy, as well as odds of crossing educational barriers, are estimated. Results suggest that, after four decades of continuous decline, overall homogamy increased in the first decade of this century. This rebound stems from a shift in the balance between long-standing opposite trends: increasing odds of intermarriage among lower educational levels and more homogamy at the top of the educational distribution. The findings are interpreted in the light of several social, economic and demographic changes that are relevant to union formation. Particularly, starting from a population with very low levels of schooling, educational expansion could initially have only a limited impact on partner markets. The link between schooling and partner choice in Brazil might have strengthened as the expansion reached upper secondary and higher education."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Abstract\nPartnered men and women show consistently gendered patterns of labor market behavior. We test whether not only a person’s own gender, but also their partner’s gender shapes hours worked. We use Dutch administrative population data on almost 5,000 persons who had both male and female partners, whose hours worked we observe monthly over 15 years. We argue that this provides a unique setting to assess the relevance of partner’s gender for labor market behavior. Using two-way fixed effects and fixed-effects individual slopes models, we find that both men and women tend to work more hours when partnered with a female partner compared to a male partner. These results align with our hypothesis that a partner’s gender influences labor market behavior. For women, we conclude that this finding may be (partly) explained by marital and motherhood status. Additionally, we discovered that women decrease their hours worked to a lesser extent when caring for a child if they have a female partner. Finally, we found that for men, the positive association between own and partner’s hours worked is weaker when one has a female partner, indicating a higher degree of specialization within these couples."

    "text": "Abstract\n\n\n\nUsing population register data from the Netherlands, we analyze the child penalty for new parents in three groups of couples: different-sex and female same-sex couples with a biological child and different-sex couples with an adopted child. With a longitudinal design, we follow parents’ earnings from two years before to eight years after the arrival of the child and use event study models to estimate the effects of the transition to parenthood on earnings trajectories. Comparing different groups of couples allows us to test hypotheses related to three types of within-couple differences that are difficult to disentangle when studying only heterosexual biological parents: relative earnings, childbearing, and gender. Our results offer strong support for gender as the main driver of divergent child penalties. The gender of their partners is more consequential for mothers’ earnings trajectories than is childbearing or the pre-parenthood relative earnings in the couple."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Abstract\n\n\n\nThis chapter examines the stratification of access to higher education in Brazil between 2001 and 2015, a period of marked expansion of the higher education system. It draws on random samples of the Brazilian population to show the increase in the number of enrollments, as well as in the number of students eligible to make the transition to higher education. Coefficients from logistic regression models show the persistent effects of family background on the probability of achieving a college education, but also show decreasing disadvantages for African-Brazilian students. It discusses how shifts in the racial composition of the population vis-à-vis policies to mitigate inequalities of access can account for the increasing probability of African-Brazilian students attending college."
